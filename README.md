This project contains a fuzzer that parses a YANG module, connects to a NETCONF server and then walks through the YANG model data, generating random data and sending it to the NETCONF server, to test the validity of the model implementation.

## Development

To install the project, a few dependencies are required.

* boofuzz
* ncclient
* libyang-python
* rstr
* xmltodict

The process of building the project and retrieving the required dependencies is
described below.

### Build instruction

To build the project, it's best to use a python venv inside the project.

```
git clone https://github.com/telekom/yang-imp-fuzzer.git

cd yang-imp-fuzzer

python3 -m venv env

source env/bin/activate

pip3 install -r requirements.txt

pip3 install ncclient
```

### Running the fuzzer

To run the fuzzer, run the following command

```
./fuzzer/fuzzer.py --model-name ietf-system --model-namespace "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-system" --ip 172.17.0.2 --port 8
30 --user netconf --password netconf --datastore running"
```

It might be useful to specify a single XPath to fuzz, for example:

```
./fuzzer/fuzzer.py --model-name ietf-system --model-namespace "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-system" --ip 172.17.0.2 --port 8
30 --user netconf --password netconf --datastore running --fuzz-xpath "/ietf-system:system/hostname"
```
